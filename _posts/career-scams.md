When you have little to no experience as a software developer or are just transitioning your career, immediately you will be besieged by adds. Adds for courses, adds for mentoring, adds for interactive roadmaps on what to follow. I strongly affirm that one should be well aware of the techniques behind them and what it is they do lest they be a stumbling block in your career.

This tirade was mainly influenced by [*this video of ThePrimeagen*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH0_LJoMJd4) and my own journey as a dev:

### Never fall for the **Learn X in Y amount** type scam

If you ever see a course stating you can learn whatever tech in X amount of time - run run run. This is not possible and you are setting yourself up not only for financial failure but also for career disappointment. Having a deadline is cool and productive but learning anything worthwhile is never such a quick process.

### Never accept starting work for whichever company without a **signed contract**

There maybe times where you will be approached by some too-good-to-be-true company. They might make you an offer to work on the latest tech and really make an inpact. But guess what - no contract. Never agreee to this. To be fair and secure both you and the company should have a contract so both sides know their rights and responsibilities. Otherwise, you can always go to reddit and read some horror stories about what happens otherwise.
