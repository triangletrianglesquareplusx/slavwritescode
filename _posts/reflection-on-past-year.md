This past year was filled with lots of situations for me to learn from. As a junior software developer it has never been more difficult to find a job and at the same time resources have never been so abundant.

With the advent of AI and its utilization in all areas of human endeavor I think it makes sense for anyone interested in tacking a crack at software development to get some advice and reflection from a junior who already has had their first year of commercial experience. Oh and to add to the believability factor, my contract was not renewed.

- Bank on your career, no one else cares about it
  Make sure that you are **constantly thinking** about how your can improve your career opportunities within your company. If you yourself don't care about it - how do you expect someone else to?
- The problem with mentors
  The mentor - mentee relationship is a special one. This also means it is **very rare**. If you do not actively seek a mentor and hold them to a high standard what are you even hoping to achieve?
- Avoid bashing anyone
  There is a trend on social media of blaming/bashing other professionals. Be it HR or high ranking executives, do not get involved in this. Did not get promoted? Contract did not get renewed? Guess who is to blame? You!
- Speak up
  We are sometimes paralyzed with the thought of the immensity of the company we work in. We might feel like our opinion is inconsequential. Wrong. Always **speak your truth** and always use the company values to defend your position. The word **office culture** is two-sided.
- Tech changes
  Technology and your particular tech stack is bound to change. **Study hard** and don't blame AI if you feel like opportunities are evaporating.
- Ask away
  Always ask your superiors for **feedback**. Written preferrably. This is important for you to grow as a professional. Feedback is non-negotional to me.
