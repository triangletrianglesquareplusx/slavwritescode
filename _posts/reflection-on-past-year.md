This past year was filled with lots of situations for me to learn from. As a junior software developer it has never been more difficult to find a job and at the same time resources have never been so abundant.

With the advent of AI and its utilization in all areas of human endeavor I think it makes sense for anyone interested in tacking a crack at software development to get some advice and reflection from a junior who already has had their first year of commercial experience. Oh and to add to the believability factor, my contract was not renewed.
